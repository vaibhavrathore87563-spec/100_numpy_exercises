# How to ignore all numpy warnings (not recommended)?

import numpy as np
np.seterr(all = 'ignore')

a = np.array([1,0])
print(1/a)


# np.seterr()--> controls how NumPy handles floating-point errors. # all = 'ignore' -->tells NumPy to ignore all floating-point warnings, including: Division by zero, Overflow, Underflow, Invalid operations
